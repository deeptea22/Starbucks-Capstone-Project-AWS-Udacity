### Project Overview
Starbucks founded by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker in 1971 is now the largest coffeehouse chain in the world. Through their constant improvisation and attention to detail, Starbucks have increased their customers immensely. Starbucks is further enhancing its customer experience with the introduction of a new Starbucks Rewards program. 

Through this program, there are three types of offers that can be sent: buy-one-get-one (BOGO), discount, and informational. In a BOGO offer, a user needs to spend a certain amount to get a reward equal to that threshold amount. In a discount, a user gains a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent. In an informational offer, there is no reward, but neither is there a requisite amount that the user is expected to spend. Offers can be delivered via multiple channels.

With this information, it would be useful to perform Customer Segmentation. Customer targeting and segmentation is a popular tactic to re-engage old customers, invite new ones and drive sales. Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing the customers into groups or clusters based on certain similarities they have so that we can market or sell to each of these groups properly. 

It was in the 1950s that, customer segmentation became a formal part of modern system. The definition of customer segmentation as given by Smith in 1956 is `Market segmentation involves viewing a heterogeneous market as a number of smaller homogeneous markets, in response to differing preferences, attributable to the desires of customers for more precise satisfactions of their varying wants`. Wedel and Kamakura also stated `Market Segmentation is an essential element of marketing in industrialized countries.  Goods can no longer be produced and sold without considering customer needs and recognizing the heterogeneity of those needs` in their book `Market Segmentation`.

Therefore, customer segmentation mainly depends on three assumptions:
- The group of customers is heterogeneous
- But these heterogeneous groupings should have characteristics that can be recognized and examined.
- Exclusive promotions to fulfil the demands of customers


### Problem Statement
A data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behaviour on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of its mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.

The problem statement is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. 

Since this problem is based on customer segmentation, it is a clustering problem. Cluster analysis is using a mathematical and statistical model to detect populations of similar customers. Since this is a clustering problem (unsupervised learning), there is no target variable but instead looks at the relationships between the input variables. Like, the relationships between the offers and demographics which respond to them.

### Proposed Solution
The first step would be to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and describe the dataset. This EDA would expose various trends, patterns and relationships that are not visibly apparent. It will also help to identify obvious errors as well as detect possible outliers.

The second step would be data visualization to understand the dataset better and get a hold of the quantity of each demographic, each type of offer or event.

To identify which groups of people are most responsive to each type of offer, and how best to present each type of offer, various models including the benchmark model(KMeans) are analyzed to determine which model helps us to solve the problem efficiently.
Apart from the benchmark model, the other model used to evaluate, will be the DBSCAN ( Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) model. This will give us a better result as it will be able to work well with outliers and noise.



### Metrics
Since this is a clustering problem (unsupervised algorithm) the metrics will help us to evaluate our model without the help of any labelled data. The metrics I will be using are the Silhouette coefficient, Elbow Method and the Dunn’s Index. These metrics allow us to evaluate the models based on similarity or dissimilarity. The SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) will also be evaluated for each model. All these together will help us finalize the number of clusters in our ultimate model.


## II. Analysis
_(approx. 2-4 pages)_

### Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
